Description
===========

noWebistra enables transitioning away from Webistrano to plain Capistrano.
Capistrano's promise is "Capistrano deployment the easy way".
Turns out there's nothing complicated or hard about deploying with
Capistrano, all that Webistrano does is provide a cumbersome deployment log
viewer in a horribly slow web user interface.

`nowebistra.sh` extracts data from a webistrano database and stores them
in a tree of text files.
The output is structured so as to make automatic processing very easy.
You can transform this output into a traditional config/deploy.rb by hand,
or you use it as-is, e. g. with the included `Capfile`.

`Capfile` uses the generated files to configure Capistrano at runtime.

Status
======

noWebistra is in early development.
Expect sharp edges and loose ends.
